# Citadel-Central-Datathon-Fall21

We got second place at the Citadel Central Datathon with an award of $2,500. Competitors were selected by cv and online assessment.

In this week-long competition, teams of 4 were asked to analyze global and US tobacco datasets to find meaningful hidden insights through data analysis. In this repo you can find our code in `code/` and see our final report at `Team_2_report.pdf`.
